    "# 2. Fitting a trend\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lab overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aim:** The purpose of this lab is to get you started with elementary time series analysis: fitting a trend and a polynomial to a time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning outcomes:** At the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Calculate a linear trend given a time series, and determine its slope and y-offset.\n",
    "2. Calculate a polynomial fit to the time series, and determine the acceleration.\n",
    "3. Gain basic familiarity with Python `xarray` data arrays, and familiarity with indices and NaNs.\n",
    "<!--4. Use the functions including: nanmean, detrend, polyfit, polyval, disp, grid, find, isnan, sqrt, and the operators ==, ~ and .^2.-->\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** You will work with the time series of carbon dioxide concentration from the Mauna Loa site.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Directions:** Answer the questions, create an `*.ipynb` and one figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an `*.ipynb` containing the commands for this assignment.  Name it `lab-2-fitting.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load the data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data are in a netCDF file.  netCDF is a common file format for oceanographic and climate data.  They can be handled several ways, but `xarray` has a number of convenient features."
