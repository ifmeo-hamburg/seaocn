    "*Loading, plotting and exporting figures* \n",
    "\n",
    "**Aim:** The purpose of this lab is to get you started with loading netCDF files, making figures and exporting figures to `*.png` files in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning outcomes:** At the end of this lab, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load `nc`-files\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make a variety of figures including:\n",
    "- a map (with coastlines marked)\n",
    "- multiple line plots (time series) on a single axis\n",
    "as well as annotate the figures and alter the colors and symbols used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Important:** The figures should be legible when shrunk to the quarter of an A4 size of paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Evaluate code in an `*.ipynb` file, use *comments*.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Export figures in `*.png` format.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use python libraries including: `matplotlib`, `xarray`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** You will download data from [ICDC](https://www.cen.uni-hamburg.de/en/icdc/data/ocean.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Directions:** Answer the questions. You will also create a git repository with your code and 3 figures.\n",
