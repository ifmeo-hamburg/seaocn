    "# Super-brief explanation of git\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is keeping track of changes to your files within the local repository (your copy of the course folder on your computer).  When you change a file in the folder, git knows.  How do you know it knows?  If you go into your Github desktop (purple icon, desktop app) and choose the repository you're working in in the dropdown menu on the left, and you have changed a file, the filename  for the file with changes will appear in a list, and to the right you can preview the changes that have been made (previous commit and current edited version).  \n",
    "\n",
    "After you've been working on a file for a while (a day, an hour, 5 minutes, etc), e.g. a piece of code in your repository on your computer, and you've made some important changes, you will want to tell git to save a snapshot of these changes.  To do this you click **commit** in Github desktop.  This will then make git store a version according to the point in time when you clicked commit.  *Advanced tip: in the commit message, you can write something useful to describe the changes, like \"added a new function to load data from a microcat\".*  So far, only your own computer knows about these changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you want to share these changes with your group, i.e. have these changes show up in the repository on the gitlab.rrz.uni-hamburg.de location, then you need to **push** the changes.  This is a button to the right in your Github desktop (or top right), where you click.  This will then make the changes appear in the online copy of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "When your group member has made changes, and you want these changes to appear in your copy of the code on your own computer, then you need to **fetch** these changes from the version on gitlab.rrz.uni-hamburg.de.  This will not overwrite any of your files.  It will simply add what they have done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For beginner usage, I recommend that you all keep a separate copy of your python code to start with.  If you work on the same piece of code, it's possible for you to delete something and commit it to your repository (on your own computer), and for someone else to edit the same thing without deleting it and commit it on their own computer.  If you both then push these changes to the repository, or you fetch your colleagues changes from the online repository onto your computer, you will get a **conflict** which needs to be merged manually.\n",
