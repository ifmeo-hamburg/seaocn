## Funding & International context

Beyond just the science and the technical requirements of a cruise, you also need to consider the funding constraints and international context of a cruise.

In different countries:

- US: Ships coordinated by UNOLS and operated by individual institutions
- UK: Ships owned by the research council, coordinated by the National Oceanography Center, and operated by either the NOC or British Antarctic Survey (RRS SDA)
- Germany: Application for cruise proposals [Portal deutsche Forschungsschiffe](https://www.portal-forschungsschiffe.de/fahrtvorschlaege-leitfaden.html)
