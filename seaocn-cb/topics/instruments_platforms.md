# Instruments & Platforms




Here, we will describe the ocean as a measurement environment, then outline the instruments and platforms available for physical oceanographic observations.

## Ocean environment
We will consider the ocean environment (physical oceanographic) and how the environment affects measurement strategies (think: pressure, corrosive salt water, etc).


## Instruments 
for physical oceanography

## Platforms 
ships, moorings, gliders, etc.
