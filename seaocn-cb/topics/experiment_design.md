```{admonition} Preparation (before class)
Please prepare two figures (one from each of the last two labs), and add them to the `shared_figures` folder in the course repository.  You can do this on your local computer, or via the web [here](https://gitlab.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/ifmeo/teaching/IfM_SeaOcean/uhh-seaocean-2024/exercises-seaocn/-/blob/main/shared_figures/readme.md). 

Name the figure `Ex<A>-<Lastname>.png` where you replace `<A>` with the exercise number (or letter) and `<Lastname>` with your last name.

Figure choice:
- Please bring one on vertical gridding
- One on horizontal gridding
(Optional, preferred) select a figure which demonstrates differences in gridding methodologies.
```


# Experiment design

Beyond just the science and the technical requirements of a cruise, you also need to consider the funding constraints and international context of a cruise.

In different countries:

- US: Ships coordinated by UNOLS and operated by individual institutions
- UK: Ships owned by the research council, coordinated by the National Oceanography Center, and operated by either the NOC or British Antarctic Survey (RRS SDA)
- Germany: Application for cruise proposals [Portal deutsche Forschungsschiffe](https://www.portal-forschungsschiffe.de/fahrtvorschlaege-leitfaden.html)
