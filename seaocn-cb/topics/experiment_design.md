```{admonition} Preparation (before class)
**For 6 May:**
Please read your assigned paper:

- Hawaiian Ocean Mixing Experiment & clever sampling of tidal beams, {cite:t}`Cole-etal-2009`: David, Anagha, Carina, Simon

- Faroe Bank Channel overflow, {cite:t}`Girton-etal-2006`: Julian, Till, Katja, Isabelle, Leonie

- Diurnal restratification, fast towed sampling {cite:t}`Hosegood-etal-2008`: Georgi, Quentin, Mikhail, Yves

Identify (this part should be quick): 

1. main question or research objective, 
2. data and sampling approach, 
3. main conclusion + supporting figure.

To discuss (this part takes more thinking): What thought process went into planning the experiment, in order to get to the conclusion?
```



# Experiment design

We will discuss experimental design.



```{admonition} Lab topic - Assignments
Assignment 1 will be available from this week.
```
<!--*Please try to catch up on the exercises.*  From week 5/6 you will have an assignment in python.  It will build on the python and methods you've been developing so far, but will require you to creatively combine what you've learned to make progress.
