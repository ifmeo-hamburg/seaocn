```{admonition} Preparation (before class)
Please prepare two figures (one from each of the last two labs), and add them to the `shared_figures` folder in the course repository.  You can do this on your local computer, or via the web [here](https://gitlab.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/ifmeo/teaching/IfM_SeaOcean/uhh-seaocean-2024/exercises-seaocn/-/blob/main/shared_figures/readme.md). 

Name the figure `Ex<A>-<Lastname>.png` where you replace `<A>` with the exercise number (or letter) and `<Lastname>` with your last name.

Figure choice:
- Please bring one on vertical gridding
- One on horizontal gridding
(Optional, preferred) select a figure which demonstrates differences in gridding methodologies.
```

# Experiment design

Now we're adding one more level.  In [Scientific basis](scientific_basis) we talked about oceanography problems or processes we'd like to investigate. In [Equations v. Data](equations_v_data) we looked at examples of how processes (as viewed in equations) can be quantified from observations (data).  In [Instruments & Platforms](instruments_platforms), we surveyed the equipment that may be available for making physical oceanographic observations.  In [AMOC methods](amoc_methods), we revisited our scientific questions with some observations in mind.  

Here we will expand and consider, what are the guiding ideas when thinking about designing an experiment?  We'll use a few more case studies, and see whether there are guiding principles that can be extracted from the thinking process.  Part of this will be in thinking about "how can the experiment fail?" (and what is a failed experiment).
