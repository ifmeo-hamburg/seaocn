# Course overview


In today's class, we will give an overview of the course aims, structure and assignments (grading).  We will also get started thinking about the scientific method for observational physical oceanography.


```{seealso}
- The [course syllabus](../overview/syllabus) outlines the course aims.
- The [schedule](../overview/schedule) gives the course schedule for 2024.

And some recommended reading:
- [Smolin's - There is No Scientific Method](https://bigthink.com/articles/there-is-no-scientific-method/) - light reading, food for though.

- {cite:t}`Richardson-2008` - On the history of MOC schematic diagrams.  A nice visual history of oceanography before electronic instruments.

```



```{admonition} Lab topic - introduction
We will also introduce the topic of Git.

After the lab, additional recommended (optional) readings include:
- {cite:t}`Wilson2017` on "Good enough practices in scientific computing"


For additional help with Git, please see:
- Software carpentry's [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) - Software carpentry is a great resource for learning basic research computing.  You can also explore some of their other resources [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/index.html).
- The Turing Way's "Guide for Reproducible Research" with the chapter on [Version Control](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/vcs), including their brief [Checklist](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-checklist) at the end.  If when reading the checklist, there are terms you don't understand, go back to the full chapter.

<!--- [Merz 1925 "Die Deutsche Atlantsche Expedition|(https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/31862/1/meteor-1925.pdf) - if you'd like some older oceanography in German.  Note especially Figure (Abb.) 53 on page 365 (page 27 of the pdf) which infers the overturning circulation.
