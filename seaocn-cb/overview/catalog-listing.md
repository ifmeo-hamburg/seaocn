# Course catalog listing

ADVANCE: Sea-going oceanography

**Course number:** 63-713

**Lecturer:** Eleanor Frajka-Williams

**Course type:** Elective core course

**Learning outcomes:** Students will have an in-depth knowledge of the principles of oceanographic instruments and measurement.  Students will be able to apply standard processing and quality control to raw oceanographic data, and understand how the processing choices relate to the measurement principles.  Further, students will compute, compare and evaluate different approaches for making oceanographic calculations, e.g. from ship-based measurements or moored platforms, and different instrument types.  Students will gain a general understanding of and apply strategies for designing a physical oceanographic field program.

**Contents:** In this course, we will go over the fundamentals of oceanographic measurements for seagoing physical oceanography.  This will include going over the principles behind the standard measurement sensors (CTD, ADCP, current meters, etc) and then seeing how the measurement principles affect our treatment of the data and errors.  This course is primarily computer-based, and you will gain experience using manufacturer’s software from standard instruments for data handling and quality control, processing in Matlab or Python, applying data correction principles, and using the data to evaluate an oceanographic phenomenon.  

At the end of the course, you should have a basic familiarity with the onboard processing and treatment of physical oceanographic datasets, so that if you go to sea you will understand approaches to treating and processing data.
