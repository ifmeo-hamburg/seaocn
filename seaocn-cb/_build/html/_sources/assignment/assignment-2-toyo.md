# Assignment - To-yos


**Aim:** The purpose of this assignment is to build some clean, easy-to-use code to work with to-yo data in real-time on a ship.  Here we ignore any data calibration problems, and instead aim for clear figures and well-documented code for easy edits.  

**Tips and hints**

1. Load `nc`-files

2. Make a variety of figures including:
- a map (with coastlines marked)
- multiple line plots (time series) on a single axis
as well as annotate the figures and alter the colors and symbols used.

3. Evaluate code in an `*.ipynb` file, use *comments*.

4. Export figures in `*.png` format.

5. Use python libraries including: `matplotlib`, `xarray`

**Data:** The data files are available in the git repository.  

**Directions:** Upload your report as an `*.ipynb` to the git repository.  You may additionally include one 1-2 page document explaining what the requirements are in order to be able to use the code (expectations for format of input, packages used, etc).
