# Scientific basis

We will introduce 2 (maybe 3) projects which have a field component.  These will be used as case studies during the course to help focus the topics.

- The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (RAPID and EPOC projects)
- Mesoscale eddy dissipation at topography
- Convection in the Labrador Sea
