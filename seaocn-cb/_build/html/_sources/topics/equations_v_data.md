```{admonition} Preparation (before class)
In class, we will discuss some of the ways ocean observations can be used with the equations governing fluid flow to understanding *something* about ocean physics.

Your homework:
- **Find a paper** which uses *in situ* oceanographic data to test a process in the ocean.  Your hint that it may be a paper on testing a process: there are equations (e.g., equations of motion).  If you're having trouble finding one, a place to start might be the [Journal of Physical Oceanography](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/phoc/phoc-overview.xml).  

- **Add a `*.pdf`** of the paper to the gitlab repository in the folder `shared_papers/` [here](https://gitlab.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/ifmeo/teaching/IfM_SeaOcean/uhh-seaocean-2024/exercises-seaocn/-/tree/main/shared_papers).

    For a naming convention, please name the figure using the lastname(s) of the paper authors, e.g., for a paper by Smith and Sandwell (2001), name the paper `Smith_Sandwell_2001-fig<fignum>.pdf` where you replace `<fignum>` with the figure number which demonstrates the use of data + equations.  For a multi-author paper with more than 2 authors, use `<Author>_etal_<YYYY>-fig<fignum>.pdf` where `<Author>` is the first author's last name, and `<YYYY>` the four digit year when the paper was published.
