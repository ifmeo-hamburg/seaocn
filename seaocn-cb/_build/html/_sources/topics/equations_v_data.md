```{admonition} Preparation (before class)
This is the week when you need to prepare a slide with a figure which uses observations and equations together.  These should be added to the `shared_paper/` folder in the gitlab.
```

# Equations v data

We will discuss what kinds of data can be recorded in order to enable further calculations with the data after the fact.

This should be based on what students bring to class.


```{admonition} Lab topic - introduction
We will continue with the ideas left off last time, in thinking about number of degrees of freedom of a time series.
```
