# Course overview


In today's class, we will give an overview of the course aims, structure and assignments (grading).  We will also get started thinking about the scientific method for observational physical oceanography.


```{seealso}
- The [course syllabus](../overview/syllabus) outlines the course aims.
- The [schedule](../overview/schedule) gives the course schedule for 2024.

And some recommended reading:

```{admonition} Lab topic - introduction
We will also introduce the topic of Git.

After the lab, additional recommended (optional) readings include:
- Software carpentry's [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) - Software carpentry is a great resource for learning basic research computing.  You can also explore some of their other resources [here](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/index.html).
- The Turing Way's "Guide for Reproducible Research" with the chapter on [Version Control](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/vcs), including their brief [Checklist](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/vcs/vcs-checklist) at the end.  If when reading the checklist, there are terms you don't understand, go back to the full chapter.
