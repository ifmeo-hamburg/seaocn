:width: 100

:name: tablechunk

* - Week
  - Topic
* - Weeks 1-4 
  - **Overview**: of the AMOC science, measurement equipment, cruise anatomy and introduction to git and python - primarily for 1-dimensional datasets.  The science and research cruise discussion will be broader, to introduce the topics, while in part 2, we will look in more detail.  For working with instruments, we will look more closely and work directly with the manufacturer's software to apply initial corrections.  This will get into the nitty gritty quickly, with the cell thermal mass and alignment problems of modern CTD instruments. Getting started with Git and Python. Cell thermal mass, align CTD problems, salinity spikes, buoyancy frequency, density definitions, filtering, and decorrelation scales.
* - Weeks 5-8
  - **Adding dimensions:** For working with data, we will add second dimensions: instead of just depth, we'll look at depth and time (moorings), and instead of just profiles (depth), we'll look at hydrographic sections.  For cruise planning, the added dimension will be considerations of cost and international context (dipclears).  For programming, we'll look into how we need to treat observational data which is incomplete (discrete and coarse resolution in depth - moorings, or in horizontal distance - hydrographic sections).  And will consider how treatment of these gaps affects calculations like gradients, transports, overturning.  
* - Weeks 10-13 (11 June - 2 July)
  - **Expansion:** The final part of the course has you synthesizing what you've learned in python and cruise planning.  We'll use high-resolution sections (gliders and to-yos) and comparisions between space-time and space-space datasets, evaluating sensitivity of transport estimates to biases and reference level choices, optimal interpolation, horizontal density gradients and potential vorticity.
* - Weeks 14 (9 July)
  - **Final presentations**
