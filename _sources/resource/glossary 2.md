bias error
  an offset of the measured values from the true values, from {cite}`Talley-etal-2011`, Chapter 6.2.

error
  the difference between a measurement result and the value of the measurand, from {cite}`Cohen-1996`.

precision
  the repeatability of an observation using a given instrument or observing system, from {cite}`Talley-etal-2011`, Chapter 6.2.

random error
  see {cite}`Talley-etal-2011`, Chapter 6.2.

uncertainty
  the reliability of the assertion that the stated measurement result represents the value of the measurand, or more specifically "a parameter, associated with the result of the measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurand" from {cite}`Cohen-1996`.
