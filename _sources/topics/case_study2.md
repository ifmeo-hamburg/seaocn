Today we'll go through the ideas of Seagoing Oceanography with a 2nd case study (MerMEED - Mechanisms Responsible for Mesoscale Eddy Dissipation).

<!--Likely also assigning the group assignment (to be due in 2 weeks) - to come up with elements (the work timetable) of a cruise proposal.-->

```{admonition} For next week
We will talk about "good scientific practice", sometimes also called "scientific integrity" or "research ethics". 

Recommended: Read snippets of {cite:t}`DFG-code-2022`, especially guidelines 12-14.  The whole thing is only 28 pages long.  Ideally this will be a discussion.


Additionally or alternatively, find a statement on good scientific practice from a funding agency in another country or at UHH, or see the resources below:

We will specifically discuss authorship, documentation and the role of research software in reproducible science.
