```{admonition} Preparation (before class)
**For 19 April:** This is the week when you need to prepare a slide with a figure which uses observations and equations together.  These should be added to the `shared_paper/` folder in the gitlab. 

Note: This was for 16 April, but only received 6 submissions.
```

```{admonition} Preparation (before computer practical)
- **Read** {cite:t}`Krause-Tomczak-1995` before completing your mapping exercise.
```


# Equations v data

We will discuss what kinds of data can be recorded in order to enable further calculations with the data after the fact.

This should be based on what students bring to class.

```

```{admonition} Lab topic - Transport 
You will use data from hydrographic sections to compute geostrophic transport.  

See [Ex4](../exercise/exercise-geostrophy.ipynb). You may find it useful to read {cite:t}`Bryden-etal-2005` (or references therein about computing geostrophic transports from sections).
```

```{warning} 
**For 30 April:** We will start the class by discussing map projections that you created during exercise 3.

You should have read {cite:t}`Krause-Tomczak-1995` before the computer practical on Apr 23, and prepared figures for the `shared_figure/` folder from [exercise 3 - maps](../exercise/exercise-map.ipynb).
```
