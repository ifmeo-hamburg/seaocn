```{admonition} Preparation (before class)
Please prepare *two figures* from the last lab, and put add it to the `shared_figures` folder in the course repository.  You can do this on your local computer, or via the web [here](https://gitlab.rrz.uni-hamburg.de/ifmeo/teaching/IfM_SeaOcean/uhh-seaocean-2024/exercises-seaocn/-/blob/main/shared_figures/readme.md). 

Name the figure `Ex<A>-<Lastname>.png` where you replace `<A>` with the exercise number (or letter) and `<Lastname>` with your last name.

# Scientific basis



We will introduce 2 (maybe 3) projects which have a field component.  These will be used as case studies during the course to help focus the topics.

- The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (RAPID and EPOC projects)
- Mesoscale eddy dissipation at topography
- Convection in the Labrador Sea


```{admonition} Lab topic - introduction
We will also introduce the lab topic of [time series](ex-timeseries).  In the lab you'll be calculating basic statistics like mean, histogram, median, standard deviation.  For a review of these concepts, see
- {cite}`Talley-etal-2011` chapter 6 "Data analysis concepts and observational methods", especially sections 6.3 "Observational error", and 6.3 "Basic statistical concepts", and 6.5.3 "Spectral analysis" and 6.5.4 "Filtering".
- {cite}`Emery-Thomson-2004` chapter 3 - note that earlier and later editions are also fine to use.
