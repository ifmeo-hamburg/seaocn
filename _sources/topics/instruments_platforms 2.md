# Instruments and platforms

This will be a whirlwind introduction to the platforms, sensors and instruments we have for measuring the ocean.


```{admonition} Labs
*Please try to catch up on the exercises.*  From week 5/6 you will have an assignment in python.  It will build on the python and methods you've been developing so far, but will require you to creatively combine what you've learned to make progress.
