```

We will discuss issues of uncertainty specific to field oceanography (as distinct from e.g., laboratory sciences).  We will not discuss in detail error propagation or statistical techniques.

```{seealso}
If you need to *do* uncertainty analysis, please see {cite:t}`Coleman-Steele-1999` chapters 2 "Statistical Considerations in Measurement Uncertainties", chapter 3 "Planning an Experiment: General Uncertainty Analysis" and maybe chapter 4 "Designing an Experiment: Detailed Uncertainty Analysis".

Or, for a straightforward description of practical error handling for oceanography, see {cite:t}`Emery-Thomson-2004`, chapter 3 "Statistical Methods and Error Handling".

```{admonition} Lab topic - Working with glider data
Note: This exercise is more advanced, showing how data can be dynamically loaded.  [Exercise 7](../exercise/exercise-glider-demo.ipynb).
```
<!--*Please try to catch up on the exercises.*  From week 5/6 you will have an assignment in python.  It will build on the python and methods you've been developing so far, but will require you to creatively combine what you've learned to make progress.
