*Added 2 June (draft)*
```

We will discuss issues of uncertainty specific to field oceanography (as distinct from e.g., laboratory sciences).  We will not discuss in detail error propagation or statistical techniques.



```{admonition} Lab topic - Working with glider data
Note: This exercise is more advanced, showing how data can be dynamically loaded.  [Exercise 7](../exercise/exercise-glider-demo.ipynb).
```
<!--*Please try to catch up on the exercises.*  From week 5/6 you will have an assignment in python.  It will build on the python and methods you've been developing so far, but will require you to creatively combine what you've learned to make progress.
