# Assignment 2

<span style="color:red">Due ~~3~~ 31 July (Wednesday)</span>

**See general feedback on assignment 1 [here](../assignment/assignment-1-feedback.md)**

Half the class will work on one problem, half on the other.  However the work is **individual** - *not group*.  You may discuss approaches with others; you may share code for loading datasets; you should decide your own analyses (can be in discussion) and write the code for the analysis yourself.

**Assignment 2:** You must turn in working code in a repository, along with the generated figures and a report.  The code should only need to be adjusted by specifying a different path for the input datasets.  Your report should include a section for future work.

**Assignment 2:** You will work on a *different* assignment than you did for assignment 1, from the same list.  You will receive the submitted assignments from the two students who worked on the project.  You will also turn in a repository, generated figures and a report.  You may re-use any code from the students' work on the assignment.  You will be assessed on the quality and completeness of  your final report; improvements relative to assignment 1 will be considered.  I.e., if the problem is answered (and answered well) by the first assignment - then please discuss with Eleanor alternate/additional checks to carry out for redoing it in assignment 2.  Or, if the problem was very difficult, and the assignment 1 submissions only got partway through, then your assignment 2 will be to complete the assessment of the dataset/methodology.

Again, for assignment 2 the work is individual - not group.  You may discuss approaches with others; you may share code for loading datasets; you should decide your own analyses (can be in discussion) and write the code for the analysis yourself.  Additionally, you can use any of the code submitted for assignment 1.

**Note:** The list of choices for Assignment 2 may be reduced.  This may happen, for example, if one of the assignments is deemed intractable in the time alloted.  You should plan to spend about 30 hours on each assignment.  *However*, this is assuming that you have kept up with the exercises in weeks 1-6.
