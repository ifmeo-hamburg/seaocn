# Report specifications

## Deadline

Your report is due to be submitted on the [MIN moodle](https://lernen.min.uni-hamburg.de/course/view.php?id=3675) by 23:59 on the date due.

## Formatting

You have two options for formatting:

- Provide a `*.pdf` file of your report
- Provide an `*.ipynb` of your report, where code and figures are generated in line.

If you submit a python notebook, you must include text sections between code blocks to provide explanations of the work.

## Contents

So the *content* requirements remain the same.  You should have sections for

- Introduction
- Background
- Data
- Methods
- Results
- Conclusion

The results should be illustrated primarily by 1--3 key figures.  You may also include a figure in the data section to show the raw data you were working with.

Overall the length should be about 5 pages.
