# MSc Seagoing Oceanography

In this course, we will go over the fundamentals of oceanographic measurements for seagoing physical oceanography. This will include going over the principles behind the standard measurement sensors (CTD, ADCP, current meters, etc) and then seeing how the measurement principles affect our treatment of the data and errors. This course is primarily computer-based, and you will gain experience using manufacturerâ€™s software from standard instruments for data handling and quality control, processing in Matlab or Python, applying data correction principles, and using the data to evaluate an oceanographic phenomenon.

At the end of the course, you should have a basic familiarity with the onboard processing and treatment of physical oceanographic datasets, so that if you go to sea you will understand approaches to treating and processing data.
